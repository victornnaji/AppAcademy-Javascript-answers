Write a method array_translate that takes in an array whose elements alternate between words and numbers. The method should return a string where each word is repeated the number of times that immediately follows in the array.

def array_translate(array)

end

print array_translate(["Cat", 2, "Dog", 3, "Mouse", 1]); # => "CatCatDogDogDogMouse"
puts

print array_translate(["red", 3, "blue", 1]); # => "redredredblue"
puts
