Write a method ae_count that takes in a string and returns a hash containing the number of a's and e's in the string. Assume the string contains only lowercase characters.

def ae_count(str)

end

puts ae_count("everyone can program") #=> {"a"=>2, "e"=>3}
puts ae_count("keyboard") #=> {"a"=>1, "e"=>1}
